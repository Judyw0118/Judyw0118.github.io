<p><b>1.1</b></p>
<p>The order of the operands doesn't matter and when adding more than 2 operands, the order of the addition doesn't matter.</p><br>


<p><b>2.1</b></p>
<p>When doing addition for octal numbers, just add as you would usually do, but if you add it and it is bigger than 7 then it carries.</p><br>


<p><b>3.1</b></p>
<p>When doing addition for hexadecimal numbers, just add as you would usually do, but after the number 9 it will be A, B, C, D, E, and F and if it to be bigger than F then it carries.</p><br>


<p><b>4.1</b></p>
<p>When doing addition for binary numbers, there is only 0 and 1, so when you add and it is bigger than 1 then it carries.</p><br><br>

<p><b>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</b></p>
 <p> I learned how to add other bases together.
</p><br>

<p><b>What challenges did I encounter?</b></p>
<p>It was confusing memorizing the different base systems.</p><br>

<p><b>How could this experience be improved?</b></p>
<p>I don't think there is anything to improve.</p><br>

<p><b>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</b></p>
<p>I learned how to convert numbers into different bases.</p>
