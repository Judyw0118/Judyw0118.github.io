	<b>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</b><br>
	I learned how to contruct various gates with only using logic inputs, logic outputs, wires, and two-input NAND gates.<br><br><br>

	<b>What challenges did I encounter?</b><br>
	When I was connecting wires to the gates it would get a bad connection and I didn't understand why there was a bad connection.<br><br><br>

	<b>How could this experience be improved?</b><br>
	I am not really sure.<br><br><br>

	<b>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</b><br>
	It allowed me to think outside of the box when I was constructing the gates<br><br>
