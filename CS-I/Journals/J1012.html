<b>1.1</b><br>
The order of the operands doesn't matter and when adding more than 2 operands, the order of the addition doesn't matter.<br><br><br>


<b>2.1</b><br>
When doing addition for octal numbers, just add as you would usually do, but if you add it and it is bigger than 7 then it carries.<br><br><br>


<b>3.1</b><br>
When doing addition for hexadecimal numbers, just add as you would usually do, but after the number 9 it will be A, B, C, D, E, and F and if it to be bigger than F then it carries.<br><br><br>


<b>4.1</b><br>
When doing addition for binary numbers, there is only 0 and 1, so when you add and it is bigger than 1 then it carries.<br><br>

<b>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</b><br>
  I learned how to add other bases together.
<br><br><br>

<b>What challenges did I encounter?</b><br>
It was confusing memorizing the different base systems.<br><br><br>

<b>How could this experience be improved?</b><br>
I don't think there is anything to improve.<br><br><br>

<b>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</b><br>
I learned how to convert numbers into different bases.
